# React: Creating and Hosting a Full-Stack Site
This is the my repository for the LinkedIn Learning course React: Creating and Hosting a Full-Stack Site.

You've learned React and can create amazing front-end interfaces. But deploying them requires more. You need logicâ€”and a place to put it. By combining your front-end UI with a back-end solution and cloud hosting, you can build powerful and interactive full-stack applications. In this project-based course, Shaun Wassell shows how to combine React, Node.js, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) in a full-stack, full-featured website, including user-friendly forms for posting articles and comments. Learn how to create an interface from React components, develop a Node.js server, tie in a MongoDB database, add user authentication with Firebase Auth, and deploy your site on Amazon Web Services. Join Shaun in this course to gain the skills to take your client services to the next level: full-stack web applications that are truly interactive.
